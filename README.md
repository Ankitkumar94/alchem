# Alchem Desktop

###### An all-in-one inventory and accounts solution for Chemist shops (both wholesale and retail) as per new Indian taxation standards.

### Why it is needed?

#### All the existing solutions don't have a good UI and UX, even getting used to those softwares take more than a month. Also, customer support is not at par. This software being OpenSource aims to become more than just a software. It aims to become a community.

## How to build?

### Project is typically made in Jetbrains Intellij IDEA, but can be migrated to any other IDE.
NOTE: Though project can be built and modified using other IDE, but same project structure has to be maintained while committed changes or raising pull requests.
